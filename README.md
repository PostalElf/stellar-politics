stellar-politics
================

This will eventually be a computer RPG, but for now it's going to be just a star system generator.

Features include:


    Star types: the size and colour of the star (e.g blue, orange-red, red) determines the size of the star 
                system. The larger the star, the larger the star system.
    Planet name: each planet is named after its star, and the star itself is named after a random Greek name. 
                 In later releases I'll let people choose their own list of star names with an XML file.
    Type of planet: independently rolled prefix determines the nature of the planet (e.g Industrial, Research, 
                    Prison) while independently rolled suffix determines the nature of the planet (e.g. 
                    Wasteland, Urban Sprawl, Eden).
    Number of cities on the planet
    Type of habitation: are the cities in an orbital ring? In a hivecity? In a cubecity? The type of 
                        habitation is limited by the suffix of the planet, so people on a Volcanic Planet 
                        will never be found living in an Undersea Dome for instance.
    Type of government: Autocracy, Oligarchy, Democracy, Anarchy?
    Goods that it imports/exports: this is limited by the prefix of the planet, so a Cultural Planet will 
                                   only export Art or Media and will, in turn, never import Art or Media.
